<br>Having a hard time deciding who's turn is it to pay for coffee? Try this algorithm ;)
<br>Given an array of employees and their information, the algorithm will help you decide which employee should pay for coffee.

## How to run the program
1. Run the executable
2. Specify how many employees are getting coffee (7 in this scenario but the program can get more employees)
3. Enter the employee's information one by one in the following format:
   > [Name] [Favorite Drink] [Drink's price] [number of times paid for coffee] (seperate each item with a white space)
   
<br>The program will return output after entering all necessary information
<br>
Alternativelly, we can also use a textfile to enter the information:
<br> i.e)

## Assumptions
- The program will assume that the number of employees provided by user is accurate
- The number of times an employee paid for coffee is a positive integer
- The input format is correct
